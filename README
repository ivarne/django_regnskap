List of dependencies:
Installable using easy_install (or `pip install -r requirements.txt`):
django      # of course, it's a django app
openpyxl    # to enable Excel export
dropbox     # for dropbox upload and make security copies of files
matplotlib  # for making graphs
reportlab   # for generating PDF files 
MySQL-python# for mysql drivers
django-extensions # for JSONField

To install:
* copy local_settings.py.dist to local_settings.py and insert your local settings (Database, apiKeys...)

Then it should behave as a normal django app:)

To get running again on pythonAnywhere
 * Create a new virtual environment on python 2.7
 * Install dependencies there
 * (Pull the changes to `__init__.py` from this commit)
 * Select that virtual environment for the webapp
