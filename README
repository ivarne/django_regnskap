List of dependencies:
Installable using easy_install:
django      # of course, it's a django app
openpyxl    # to enable Excel export
dropbox     # for dropbox upload and make security copies of files
mathplotlib # for making graphs
reportlab   # for generating PDF files 
MySQL-python# for mysql drivers
django-extensions # for JSONField

To install:
* copy local_settings.py.dist to local_settings.py and insert your local settings (Database, apiKeys...)

Then it should behave as a normal django app:)
