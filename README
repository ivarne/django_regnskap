List of dependencies:
Installable using easy_install:
django      # of course, it's a django app
openpyxl    # to enable Excel export
dropbox     # for dropbox upload and make security copies of files

To install:
copy local_settings.py.dist to local_settings.py and insert your local settings (Database, apiKeys...)

Then it should behave as a normal django app:)
